- **Categories**: Use existing product categories from your store
- **Search Terms**: Use specific product names or popular search terms

### Design Guidelines:
- Banners maintain consistent styling automatically
- Text is automatically responsive and optimized for dark/light modes
- Images remain the same (currently gaming-themed) but text is fully customizable
- Preview feature ensures content looks good before going live
